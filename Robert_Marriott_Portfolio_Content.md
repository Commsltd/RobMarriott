## Professional Profile
**Headline:** Designing and Rebuilding Complex Learning Programmes at Scale

I specialise in designing, rescuing and scaling complex Learning & Development programmes in environments where credibility has been lost, stakeholders are fragmented, and failure carries reputational and commercial risk.

My work typically begins where programmes are already under strain: weak design, low trust, competing agendas, and limited or no budget. I lead end-to-end programme redesigns using a consultative, evidence-led approach—integrating stakeholder engagement, data analytics, governance, and benefits realisation to create learning systems that are sustainable and adopted.

I have rebuilt national professional development programmes spanning multiple disciplines, regions and professional institutions, aligning learning pathways to chartership, organisational strategy and operational reality. These programmes required balancing time, cost, scope, quality and risk while coordinating senior leaders, subject-matter experts and operational teams across the business.

In addition, I have built many large professional development programmes from scratch utilising a consultative, project/programme management approach.

The outcomes have been tangible and board-level: materially improved professional pass rates, restored engagement and confidence, scalable programme architectures, and increased investment in people development. Directors work with me when programme complexity, risk and visibility demand senior L&D leadership—not just delivery.

## Major Programmes (Case Studies)

### A. The APC Programme (Assessment of Professional Competence)

**Context:**
In 2015, the APC programme (QS, PM, BS, Engineering) was failing. 4 predecessors had resigned due to stress.
*   **Challenge:** Weak design, low trust, failing leadership, no budget.
*   **Mandate:** Restore trust, rebuild the programme, "put L&D back on the map".

**Strategy:**
Secured agreement for a 1-year timeline (vs expected 3 months) to ensure success using a consultative approach aligned to APM principles. Used the **Project Management Trilemma** (Cost, Time, Quality, Risk, Scope) to justify the approach.

**Phases:**
*   **Phase 1 (Concept):** Presented vision, benefits, and high-level plan (Hybrid lifecycle).
*   **Phase 2 (Analytics):** Deep investigation. Reviewing survey questions, creating dashboards.
*   **Phase 3 (Trust Building):** "Safe space" roadshows (starting with Leeds pilot). Listening to frustrations before proposing solutions.
*   **Phase 4 (Alignment):** Power-Interest Grid. Aligning all UK offices (Leeds, Birmingham, Bristol, London, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Belfast). Established Leadership Sponsor and Coordinator structure.
*   **Phase 5 (Insights):** Shared data trends/themes. Proposed 5 options -> 2 recommended. *Result:* 90% blocker identification and mitigation.
*   **Phase 6 (Business Case):** Strategic context, Economic analysis (ROI), Commercial approach, Financial case, Management approach.
    *   *Manchester Challenge:* Used empathy and support ("open door") to win back a disillusioned office.
*   **Phase 7 (PMP):** WBS, Gantt, RACI, Risk/Issue management.
*   **Phase 8 (Deployment):**
    *   **Training:** 50 courses built with SMEs.
    *   **Prep Sessions:** Documents checking, Presentation training, Pre-qual interview, Mock interview (with RICS fellows).
    *   **Operations:** Created efficient Visio workflows for coordinators, saving 2 days/person/week.
